# Solid-Principles:
S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles. These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.

### "S" Stands for (Single Responsibility Principle):
A class should have one & only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

### "O" Stands for (Open Closed Principle):
Object and entities should be open for extension but closed for modification means that a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself.

### "L" Stands for (Liskov Substitution Principle):
It says that the object of a derived class should be able to replace an object of the base class without bringing any errors in the system or modifying the behavior of the base class.

### "I" Stands for (Interface Segregation Principle):
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or client should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. 

### "D" Stands for (Dependency Inversion Principle):
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
